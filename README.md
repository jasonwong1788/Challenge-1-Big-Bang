# Challenge-1-Big-Bang

1) This programme is creating a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word "BIG". Meanwhile, replace any number divisible by 5 with the word "BANG". If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it with "BIGBANG". After that, the programme will generate the array and output the result to the "output.json" file.

2) Besides, the user clicks the "Download JSON File" button.Â 

3) Next, the programme will create an empty array that it will call "FinalNumberAnswer". Then, it will run a loop from 1 to 100 in order to determine if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. If the number does not meet the divisible requirement, it will remain the same.

4) Moreover, the programme will go through the first condition which is checking the number to see if it can be divisible by 3 and 5 in order to replace it with "BIGBANG".

5) In addition, the programme will go through the second condition which is checking the number to see if it can be divisible by 3 in order to replace it with "BIG".

6) Furthermore, the programme will go through the third condition which is checking the number to see if it can be divisible by 5 in order to replace it with "BANG".

7) Subsequently, the programme will go through the last condition which is checking the number to see if it cannot be divisible by 3, 5, or both in order to maintain the current number.

8) Additionally, the programme will prepare all the data required in order to convert and exchange the FinalNumberAnswer array to a JSON string file.

9) Lastly, the programme will automatically download the "output.json" text file to your device.
